Abstract: This paper focuses on beauty meson decays to open charm final states, which provide valuable insight into spectroscopy of \(b\bar{b}\) and \(b\bar{s}\) systems.  
The analysis includes the full Run 1 and Run 2 datasets and presents several new branching fraction measurements, contributing to a better understanding of hadronic beauty decays.
