SALT, a new dedicated readout Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) for the Upstream Tracker (UT) in the LHCb detector, has been developed. It is a 128-channel chip using a low-power analogue front-end, a 40 MSps 6-bit ADC per channel, and integrated digital signal processing including pedestal and mean common mode subtraction as well as zero suppression.
