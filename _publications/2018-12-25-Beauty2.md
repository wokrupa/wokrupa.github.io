This contribution reviews the latest results on CP violation measurements in decays of b and c hadrons obtained at the Large Hadron Collider.  
Analyses from the LHCb, ATLAS, and CMS experiments are summarized, covering datasets from Run 1 (2011–2012) and Run 2 (2015–2018) at centre-of-mass energies between 7 and 13 TeV. These results provide stringent tests of the Standard Model and constraints on possible contributions from new physics.
