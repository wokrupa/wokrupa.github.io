This work describes a dedicated software framework for the monitoring and calibration of silicon detectors in the LHCb Upgrade I. The platform integrates real-time data acquisition, calibration algorithms, and visualization tools to support efficient detector operation and performance studies. The system was developed within the LHCb collaboration and has been successfully used for prototype characterization and commissioning tests.
