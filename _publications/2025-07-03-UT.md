Abstract: This paper reports detailed analyses of the calibration parameters of the LHCb Upstream Tracker (UT), a silicon microstrip detector for the LHCb upgrade. The study covers both hardware and software calibration aspects, with emphasis on ASIC configuration, signal equalization, noise performance, and the impact of environmental factors on stability.
