This paper reports detailed analyses of the calibration parameters of the LHCb Upstream Tracker (UT), a silicon microstrip detector for the LHCb upgrade. The study covers both hardware and software calibration aspects, with emphasis on ASIC configuration, signal equalization, noise performance, and the impact of environmental factors on stability. The work was presented at the 20th Anniversary Trento Workshop on Advanced Silicon Radiation Detectors (TREDI2025) and demonstrates the robustness and precision of the UT calibration strategy for Run 3 and beyond.
