title: "Calibration pipelines and data monitoring for LHCb - Upstream Tracker."
excerpt: "This work develops front-end calibration pipelines for the LHCb Upstream Tracker (UT) detector using the LHCb - Gaudi framework. An integrated online monitoring system within the LHCb Online Monitoring Framework enables continuous performance tracking through key metrics such as DAQ efficiency, occupancy, and noise levels in the readout channels. Together, these tools provide rapid anomaly detection and ensure stable detector operation during Run 3 & 4.<br/><img src='/images/1760380224115.jpg'>"
