## Wojciech Krupa - about me


I am a postdoctoral researcher at Syracuse University, based at CERN, Geneva, working within the [LHCb collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10515).

My scientific interests include detector instrumentation, software development for large-scale high-energy physics experiments, and data-driven approaches to detector calibration.  
I am passionate about combining physics insight with computational tools such as Python, C++, ROOT, and modern CI/CD workflows to ensure the reliability and precision of particle tracking systems at the LHC.

My current research focuses on the operation, calibration, and performance optimization of the [Upstream Tracker (UT)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344795457_The_LHCb_Upstream_Tracker_Upgrade) detector — one of the key silicon subsystems of the LHCb experiment.  
I am part of the UT Operation team as a calibration and monitoring specialist and Data Quality Expert, responsible for developing and maintaining calibration and monitoring software pipelines with continuous integration and deployment.

Previously, I was an Assistant Professor at the AGH University of Science and Technology in Kraków, where I lectured on physics and machine learning and supervised students.  
During that time, I contributed to sensor characterization and [SALT ASIC](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/1/107) testing for the [LHCb Upgrade I](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10515).  
I also participated in several test beams at CERN and served on local organizing committees for international conferences.

I hold a PhD in Physics from AGH University of Science and Technology.  
I am fluent in Polish and English, with working knowledge of French.

In total, I am a co-author of over 370 scientific publications within the LHCb collaboration and the author of several independent works on detector calibration and data analysis in high-energy physics.
